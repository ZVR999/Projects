# Projects

Welcome to my projects repo!

Included are the projects that I'm currently working on (besides the FinTech Applications that prefer to not display) all of which are hosted through gitpages at https://zvr999.github.io/Projects/.

Yes, oddly enough I had to make my resume a "project" lol whatever helps me to complete it right? xD

I'll try and think of cool projects to build, but for now I'm going to focus on the whole "just build anything and make something cool when you have enough practice"  process.
